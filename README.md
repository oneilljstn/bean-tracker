# Bean Tracker

Bean tracker is a simple web app for users to track configuration settings for their coffee beans.
Users can store the following details about a particular bean for future reference next time they are dialing in their espresso.
 - Name
 - Grinder setting
 - Grinder duration
 - Image/photo of the beans packaging
 - Additional notes

 The application was designed for personal use and as an opportunity to practice my React development skills. The app was bootstrapped using Create-React-App. 
 - Authentication - Firebase Authentication
 - Storage - Firebase Storage 
 - Database - Firestore
 - UI - The CSS is custom and currently targeting mobile users. I am working on making the site more responsive for other devices.
- I overused Git as a chance to practice.
